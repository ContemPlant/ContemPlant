Note that our code is optimized for these components and should work optimally with them, but it may also work with slightly different components.

_The components can be purchased separately and are completely independent of the ContemPlant project. We're just using them in our box and refer to them here, to let our fans know what we've built. We have no business or any other relations with the relevant companies._

_Of course, all names are owned by the respective companies. We do not own any rights to these components._
